# Sample multiselection in ajax datasources for Angular
This is a rapid sample for the propose to change @angular/cdk/collections/selection replacing the Set object javascript collection for a Map object

In this sample the data source is a https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos' url with 5000 rows for testing propose.

I deploy a standard table component, and modify the table datasource to change a static table to remote data obtaining by rest http request.

Modidfy the selection.ts to change Set object by Map object and inject in the constructor the "key" for each selection, the key is a field in the row data requested, it it's very usual, a key is crucial to update the remote data.
